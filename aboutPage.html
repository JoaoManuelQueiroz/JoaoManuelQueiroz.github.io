                    <p class="padding-none">I am an undergraduate student in Astrophysics at the Federal University of Sergipe (UFS), where I have been studying since 2020. From 2022 to 2023, I conducted research on supervised machine learning methods in Python for dark energy reconstruction and expansion dynamics under the guidance of Dr. Javier Ernesto Gonzalez. I also served as project manager and technical director of the UFS rocket competition team, Zenith Rocketry, and as the administrator of the AstrofísicaUFS page, an outreach project of the UFS Physics Department (2022-2024). Additionally, I participated in the "AstutosUFS" project (2023-2024), creating tutorial videos on non-parametric supervised methods in cosmology.

                <p>Since 2023, I have specialized in data analysis using libraries like Pandas, as well as programming languages such as Python and SQL, applying these skills regularly to astrophysics projects. I was awarded a CNPq Scientific Initiation fellowship, conducting research on matter density perturbations under the supervision of Dr. Javier Ernesto Gonzalez (2023-2024). Currently, my focus is on cosmology, with particular interest in Cosmic Background Radiation.</p>
