                    <p class="padding-none">I am an undergraduate student in Astrophysics at the Federal University of Sergipe (UFS) since 2020. During the period from 2022 to 2023, I conducted studies on supervised machine learning methods in Python for dark energy reconstruction and expansion dynamics under the guidance of Dr. Javier Ernesto Gonzalez. I served as project manager and technical director of the UFS rocket competition team, and also as the administrator of the AstrofísicaUFS page, an extension project of the UFS Physics Department (2022-2024). I participated in the "AstutosUFS" project (2023-2024), creating tutorial videos on the use of non-parametric supervised methods in cosmology.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Since 2023, I have specialized in data analysis using libraries like Pandas, as well as programming languages such as Python and SQL, applying these skills routinely in astrophysics projects. I was a CNPq Scientific Initiation fellow, researching matter density perturbations under the supervision of Dr. Javier Ernesto Gonzalez (2023-2024), and I am currently focused on cosmology, particularly cosmic background radiation. I am fluent in Portuguese, proficient in English, and have intermediate knowledge of German and Spanish.</p>
